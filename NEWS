Summary of important user-visible changes for releases of the csg-toolkit package
===============================================================================
CSG-Toolkit-1.2.1  Release Date: 2021-04-18  Release Manager: Andreas Bertsatos
===============================================================================

** First official resease.

A GNU Octave package for analyzing diaphyseal cross sectional geometry.

The present package is based on the long-bone-diaphyseal-CSG-Toolkit and has
been created to simplify its installation and usage from within GNU Octave.

===============================================================================
CSG-Toolkit-1.2.2  Release Date: 2022-06-05  Release Manager: Andreas Bertsatos
===============================================================================

* Removed dependency of matgeom and statistics packages.
* longbone_maxDistance has been ported to C++ to speed up processing time.
* Renamed function: slice_Mesh_plane -> meshSection.
* Added functions for 3D meshes: writeObj, renameObj, meshArea, meshBarycenter.
* An additional function 'longbone_Scaling' has been added to facilitate batch
scaling of long bone models produced with 3D photogrammetry that lack real
world scale.  Type 'help longbone_Scaling' for more info.
* Additional core functionality with the new longbone_CustomGeometry function,
which allows an arbitrary number of user defined cross section to be analyzed.
Type 'help longbone_CustomGeometry' for more info.
* Updated functionality in visualize_CrossSections function to include the new
capabilities of the 'longbone_CustomGeometry' function.
Type 'help visualize_CrossSections' for more info.
* Updated help files to texinfo format.

===============================================================================
CSG-Toolkit-1.2.3  Release Date: 2022-06-06  Release Manager: Andreas Bertsatos
===============================================================================

* Moved the package sources to a new separate repository from the original
  'long-bone-diaphyseal-CSG-Toolkit', which is maintained for reference only.

===============================================================================
CSG-Toolkit-1.3.0  Release Date: 2023-04-02  Release Manager: Andreas Bertsatos
===============================================================================

* Restructured scripts into functions: inspect_CSG, longbone_Analysis.
* Added new function for fragments: longbone_FragmentGeometry
* Removed output arguments from Geometry functions. They only output CSG
properties to CSV files.
* longbone_Analysis can handle batch processing for all Geometry functions.
* Added GitHub Pages documentation.

===============================================================================
CSG-Toolkit-1.3.1  Release Date: 2024-01-30  Release Manager: Andreas Bertsatos
===============================================================================

* Bug Fix in longbone_Scaling.

===============================================================================
CSG-Toolkit-1.3.2  Release Date: 2024-03-21  Release Manager: Andreas Bertsatos
===============================================================================

* Added new function for estimating sex: estimate_sex.
* Updated 'longbone_Geometry' to return GEOM and SMoA structures as well as
  the type of bone, which if not defined by the user it can be automatically
  identified by the 'longbone_Registration' function.
